resistor_ action flipper app

This mini-app is designed as an alternative to fliping over the 3(4) action cards.

the 3(4) cards are:
"flip over"-this action sigifies that a player has fliped one of the central cards over in the direction of the arrow on the card.

"switch out"- The player takes one of the 4 available cards and replaces a card in the line up in the same orientation.

"draw and trash"- this one tends to wind up trash and draw, but you are drawing from the deck and trashing a card from the hand it
is placed into.

The last one is an optional card for more advanced games
"lock down"- this action prevents another card in the line from being tampered with by the use of a separate card. both palyers have one of these, once the other player has used the action, the previous lock gets removed so it can be used on the next turn.
